# Tachikoma Console

A futuristic AI agent interface built with Angular 19 and the Gemini API.

## Overview

Tachikoma Console is an experimental dashboard and chat interface that simulates a multi-agent system. It features a cyberpunk aesthetic and integrates with Google's Gemini API to power three distinct agent personas:

* **Logikoma**: A pure analytical engine.
* **Ghost-1**: An emergent consciousness focused on philosophy and abstraction.
* **Moderator**: A system controller that synthesizes the discussion.

## Features

* **Multi-Agent Chat Protocol**: A unique chat interface where agents interact with each other and the user.
* **Cyberpunk UI**: Custom dark theme with neon accents, scanlines, and glitch effects.
* **Angular 19**: Built with the latest Angular features, including Signals and Standalone Components.
* **Gemini API Integration**: Uses the official Google Generative AI SDK.
* **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.
